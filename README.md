# NC_Backup
A backup tool for Nucleus Co-op.

[My Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/birden_)

## What it does
- Backs up the needed files from the Nucleus main folder. (Game saves, profiles and nucleus configs)
- Backs up the whole Nucleus environment folder (%userprofile%/NucleusCoop). (game Saves)

## Warning ⚠️
- This will not back up handlers that save in the main game save path (e.g., Elden Ring, Dark Souls, some recent Unity games). Back those up manually. These will usually have a folder/file with Nucleus steamIDs or players names in their save path. 

## How to use 
1. Download the .zip from [release](https://github.com/birdenly/NC_Backup/releases/tag/release)
2. Unzip it anywhere and run the NC Backup Tool.exe
3. Follow the instructions in the console.
4. When needed unpack the backup_env.zip into your %userprofile% folder and backup_main.zip into your new Nucleus Co-op folder.

## For the handlers:
- After unpacking the backup_main.zip into your new Nucleus folder
1. Open Nucleus
2. On the top, Click the icon: ![manual install](glass.png)
3. Find the .exe for the games you backed up. (same one you selected when you downloaded the game)
